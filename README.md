Date: March 2023 - Present

Keywords:
Machine Learning, Species Distributions, Statistical Analysis, Ecology

Description:
As a volunteer researcher, I worked on machine learning and statistical projects to model species distributions for present-day and future climate scenarios.

Responsibilities:
- Researched and modeled species distributions of Butterflies in Kruger National Park 
- Developed methods in Python to filter, clean, and simulate data, enabling the subsequent implementation of an ensemble prediction model for predicting present and future distributions
- Conducted data analysis to discover trends in distributions between taxonomy, species life history, and environment
